 TIME - TIME OF THE MEASUREMENT (Z IS UTC IS GREENWICH TIME)

 AMPL - TSUNAMI AMPLITUDE MEASURED RELATIVE TO NORMAL SEA LEVEL.

        IT IS ...NOT... CREST-TO-TROUGH WAVE HEIGHT.

        VALUES ARE GIVEN IN BOTH METERS(M) AND FEET(FT).

 PER  - PERIOD OF TIME IN MINUTES(MIN) FROM ONE WAVE TO THE NEXT.

 NOTE - DART MEASUREMENTS ARE FROM THE DEEP OCEAN AND THEY

        ARE GENERALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN WOULD BE COASTAL

         MEASUREMENTS AT SIMILAR LOCATIONS.

EVALUATION

 SEA LEVEL READINGS INDICATE A TSUNAMI WAS GENERATED. IT MAY HAVE

 BEEN DESTRUCTIVE ALONG COASTS NEAR THE EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER AND

 COULD ALSO BE A THREAT TO MORE DISTANT COASTS. AUTHORITIES SHOULD

 TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS POSSIBILITY. THIS

 CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR SEA LEVEL DATA TO DETERMINE THE

 EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT.

 FOR ALL AREAS - WHEN NO MAJOR WAVES ARE OBSERVED FOR TWO HOURS

 AFTER THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL OR DAMAGING WAVES HAVE NOT

 OCCURRED FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS THEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN ASSUME

 THE THREAT IS PASSED. DANGER TO BOATS AND COASTAL STRUCTURES CAN

 CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO RAPID CURRENTS. AS LOCAL

 CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE A WIDE VARIATION IN TSUNAMI WAVE ACTION THE

 ALL CLEAR DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

ESTIMATED INITIAL TSUNAMI WAVE ARRIVAL TIMES AT FORECAST POINTS

WITHIN THE WARNING AND WATCH AREAS ARE GIVEN BELOW. ACTUAL

ARRIVAL TIMES MAY DIFFER AND THE INITIAL WAVE MAY NOT BE THE

LARGEST. A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND THE TIME BETWEEN

SUCCESSIVE WAVES CAN BE FIVE MINUTES TO ONE HOUR.
