EVALUATION

 THERE IS A VERY SMALL POSSIBILITY OF A DESTRUCTIVE LOCAL TSUNAMI

ESTIMATION AT THE FORECAST POINTS - NO TSUNAMIS WITH

AMPLITUDE OF 0.5 METER OR OVER ARE EXPECTED AT ANY OF THEM.

HOWEVER AT SOME COASTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE NEAR THE EPICENTER, HIGHER

TSUNAMIS MAY ARRIVE THAN OUR ESTIMATION

AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBILITY.

THIS WILL BE THE FINAL BULLETIN UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES ABOUT

THE POTENTIAL OF TSUNAMI GENERATION BY RE-EVALUATION OF THE

EARTHQUAKE OR THERE ARE REPORTS ON TSUNAMI OBSERVATIONS.
